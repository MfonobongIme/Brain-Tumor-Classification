# Brain Tumor Classifier

## Overview

This model is a deep learning-based classifier that can identify the presence of a brain tumor in an MRI scan. It has been trained on a large dataset of MRI scans labeled with the presence or absence of a brain tumor.

## Usage

To use the model, you will need to provide an MRI scan in the form of a 3D numpy array. The model will then output a probability score indicating the likelihood of the presence of a brain tumor in the scan.
